# E-Commerce-Rest-API
This is an E-Commerce Rest Project. In this project I have three services, Inventory, Customer Cart and Storefront which use Netflix's Eureka to make calls to one another. The basic class in this project is "Product" which consists of variables: Product ID, product name, product quantity, as well as price. Both Inventory and Customer Cart are connected to MYSQL. The Inventory service allows you to add, remove, change product names and prices, as well as a few other sorting features. Customer Cart service is where products are added or removed from the customers cart. Store Front is the service that ties Inventory and Customer Cart together. As the name states, it serves as a "store" where you can add/remove products from your cart. Each of these actions use two seperate calls to the Inventory service, as well as the Customer Cart service. With each call correctly adjusting each services database.
